## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

./js: <br>
(js/index.js) <br><br>
./Styled: <br>
(css/general.css.css) <br>
(css/card-personal.css.css) <br>
(css/all-cards.css.css.css) <br>
(css/responsive.css.css)  <br>


### What I learned

 ```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  z-index: 300;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development

I need to focus on projects that use more Java Script, because it's a language I like and I intend to delve deeper. Also, I need to learn more derivatives of CSS functions to have a wider range of applications.


### Useful resources

- [Site 1](https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/294247/como-quebrar-div-em-duas-colunas) - This helped me understand how to break DIV's. I really liked this model and will use it from now on.

- [Site 2](https://www.visualdicas.com.br/programacao/css/59-tecnica-para-cortar-e-centralizar-imagens-responsivas-com-css) - This is an amazing article that helped me understand how to crop images that go beyond their parent DIV's.
